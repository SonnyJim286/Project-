Sonny:There's a big problem. The algorithm of the timetable did not meet the expectations. The algorithms written before only copied the data in the database and did not write a timetable. A large part of it will have to be done again

Sonny:Today, I didn't make anything. I thought the arrangement I imagined would succeed, but the program couldn't run or read the data. I feel very anxious.
